TODO:

  keys_in_nodes
  
  last column of factor.probs sorted should be floats, now strings
  
  factor reduction without a for-loop

test:

  multiple queries
  
  multiple values (more than 2 / binary)
  
  multiple factors multiplied
  
  multiple common variables when multiplying
  
  multiple observed variables when reducing
  
  knowledge clip
  
  conditional distributions (with observed variables)
