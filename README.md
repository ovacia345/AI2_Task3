  last column of factor.probs sorted should be floats, now strings
  factor reduction without a for-loop

test:

  multiple values (more than 2 / binary)
  multiple factors multiplied
  multiple common variables when multiplying
  multiple observed variables when reducing
  knowledge clip
  conditional distributions (with observed variables)
